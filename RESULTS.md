# Results: weeks 1 and 2

Date: 2026-11-04. Machine for everything below: a CPU-only Windows laptop, Python 3.12, NumPy 2.5, SciPy 1.18,
CVXPY 1.9.3, SCS 3.3.1, PEPit 0.5.1. No GPU session has run yet; the Colab rows are empty until the
notebook runs and are to be filled from the ledger on Drive.

## Tests

`pytest`: 193 tests; 191 pass on the machine above and the 2 live-API tests (marker `online`) are skipped
without keys (about 4 minutes; the PEP suite solves 30 SDPs with SCS, the judge suite spawns a sandbox per
case). Every certifier ships with more than 20 known-answer cases (quadrature: 61, PEP: 33, witness: 31;
judge: 24, ledger, cost, budget and config: 15, roles and providers: 20, weights: 6, demo: 3),
the judge's limits are exercised (static and run-time forbidden imports, timeout, memory, network, crash,
determinism), and the demo loop runs end to end on replayed fixtures.

## The Davis-Yin calibration

Three-operator splitting with f1 L1-smooth mu1-strongly convex, f2 convex, f3 L3-smooth convex;
mu1 = 0.1, L1 = 10, L3 = 1, alpha = 1, theta = 1, n = 4; metric ||w_n - w_n'||^2 / ||w_0 - w_0'||^2.

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| certified rate (SCS, eps 1e-9) | 0.475452321 |
| bound rebuilt from the dual multipliers | 0.475452322 |
| PEPit 0.5.1 reference (MOSEK, example docstring) | 0.4754523346 |
| difference | 1.4e-8 (tolerance 1e-4) |
| dual slack matrix, smallest eigenvalue | -9.6e-10 |
| function-value terms residual | 2.4e-11 |
| smallest inequality multiplier | -2e-18 |
| quadratic-instance lower bound (curvature L1) | 0.466507 |
| Gram size, constraints | 26, 170 |
| solve time | 11.6 s (cap 60 s) |

The other three methods, same solver and tolerance:

| Method | Parameters | Certified | Published | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| gradient descent, distance | mu 0.1, L 1, gamma 1, n 1 | 0.810000000 | 0.81 (tight) | matches |
| gradient descent, distance | mu 0.1, L 1, gamma 1, n 3 | 0.531440999 | 0.531441 (tight) | matches |
| Nesterov, function value | mu 0.1, L 1, n 2 | 0.347602233 | 0.467544 (upper bound); PEPit reference 0.3476022263 | under the bound, matches the reference |
| Douglas-Rachford, contraction | mu 0.1, L 1, alpha 3, theta 1, n 2 | 0.350127796 | 0.3501277966 (tight) | matches |

No closed-form published rate is used for Davis-Yin: Davis & Yin (2017) give linear rates under extra
assumptions that are not tight, and the sharpest known rates (Lee, Yi & Ryu 2022; Yi & Ryu 2022) are for
operator classes that differ from this one. The calibration point is PEPit's documented value.

## The demo loop, offline (machinery check, not a baseline)

`python -m lab.demo --target quad-d7 --attempts 16 --provider local --mode offline`

The 16 responses are synthetic, hand-written to cover the kinds of output a model produces (see
`tests/make_fixtures.py`): three derivations of the 4-node Gauss rule and one hard-coded copy, a 5-node
Gauss rule, an 8-node Newton-Cotes rule, a 5-node Lobatto rule, Simpson, a 3-node Gauss rule, two forbidden
imports, a prose-only answer, a syntax error, a crash, mismatched lengths, and a weight perturbed by 1e-6.

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| valid rules (exact to degree 7) | 7 / 16 |
| optimal (4 nodes, the scoreboard's best known value) | 4 / 16 |
| pass@1, pass@16 (valid) | 0.438, 1.000 |
| pass@1, pass@16 (optimal) | 0.250, 1.000 |
| verify-first check (best known value found at least once) | PASS, 4 times in 16 attempts |
| cost | $0.0008 (judge CPU time only; no GPU seconds, no tokens; offline rows never count against the budget) |
| ledger rows written | 16 attempts (provider `local`, mode `offline`) + 1 group summary |

These numbers test the loop, the judge and the ledger. They say nothing about Qwen3.6-27B.

## Serving and the frozen baseline (to be filled from the first Colab session)

| Tier | Precision | Build | tokens/s | units/h (source) | $/h | smoke attempt id |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A100 | int4 | | | | | |
| H100 or G4 | bf16 | | | | | |

| Target | Precision | Attempts | pass@1 valid | pass@1 optimal | pass@16 optimal | optimal found | units | $ | group id |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| quad-d7 | int4 | 16 | | | | | | | |
| quad-d7 | bf16 | 16 | | | | | | | |

Precision used so far: none (no GPU session). Units spent so far: 0. The frozen base is not yet pinned:
`config/model.yaml` gets its checkpoint hash from the first run of `colab/serve.ipynb`. A run on the 4-bit
build is marked `int4` in the ledger and never enters a reported cell; the bf16 row is the one that counts.
